Delhi has the highest crime rate as well the the incidence of the crimes (all crimes combined)
Uttar Pradesh has shown low crime rate but high incidences of crime indicationg that when compared with respect to the states population, the crimes are not that significant but in absolute numbers they are quite high
One very interesting observation in Gujrat was there were lower number of victims than the incidences indicating that there are more crimes realted to public properties where no person is harmed bt damaged is caused to public properties
The plot of dowry deaths and cruelty by husband was plotted and it was noticed (for majority of the states) that the peaks of both the crimes occured in the same states indicating there may be some relation between the two
